WebSpring – easy configurable service action framework

Usage cases: 
  • SMS-services: 
    o	Weather
    o	Horoscope
    o	Subscribe/unsubscribe service
  •	Api-calls:
    o	Example service api
    o	Translator api
  •	AJAX/RPC calls

Advantages:
  •	Service trees written once, and can be used with any output template/view
  •	Caching technology
  •	Advanced Logging
  •	Extra-easy configurable. 

Typical service development steps:
  •	Define paths for your service (“usage cases”) ~ 10min
  •	Decompose path task into small handlers ~ 20min
  •	Create necessary Processors, or use existing ones ~ 1hour
  •	Configure caching and logging ~5min
  •	Deploy ~1min
Resulting time for setting up average generic service: 1 hour 36 minutes ;)
